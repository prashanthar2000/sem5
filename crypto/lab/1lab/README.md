# Pseudo Random Number Generation

### Task 1: Generate Encryption Key in a Wrong Way

###### step 1 

```sh 
$gcc task1.c -o task1
$./task1
$./task1
$./task1
```

#### observations 
- based on the value of srand(that is seed value ) pseudo random number is generated 
- 2 random number generated at a same time will generate same number which is a wrong way to generate a truly random number 

###### step 2 
> comment the srand(time(NULL))   and excecute the same command of step one 

<img src="https://github.com/prashanthar2000/cryptography_lab/raw/master/1lab/no_seed.png" width=1000 >

#### observations 
- on commenting the srand(time(NULL)) the generated number will always be same
- there fore its not a truly random number generator but its a pseudo random number generator


### Task 2: Guessing the Key
###### step 1
```sh 
$ date -d "2018-04-17 21:08:49" +%s
1523979529

$ date -d "2018-04-17 23:08:49" +%s
1523986729
```

###### step 2
```sh 
$ gcc task2.c -o task2
$ ./task2
 ```
 
 - keys.txt file is created based on the time it value 1 and value 2 
 - all the possible keys that could be generated between the time is in keys.txt

###### step 3 
```sh 
$ python decrypt.py
```
<img src="https://github.com/prashanthar2000/cryptography_lab/raw/master/1lab/decrypt.png" width=1000 >

#### observations 
- we see that giving time as the seed value is not a truly random value 
- therefore it is not wise to use time as a seed value to generate truly random number 
- as in the above case we see that we are able to crack the cipher text by knowing the time gap

### Task 3: Measure the Entropy of Kernel
```sh 
$ watch -n .1 cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
```
<img src="https://github.com/prashanthar2000/cryptography_lab/raw/master/1lab/entropy_avail.png" width=1000 >
- the value keeps increasing on pressing any key or moving mouse 

### Task 4: Get Pseudo Random Numbers from /dev/random
```sh 
$ watch -n .1 cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
$ cat /dev/random | hexdump
```
- entropy_avail value changes continoulsy from 0 to 60-70 (as fas as i could see )
- cat /dev/random prints random numbers only when there is enough entropy

### Task 5: Get Pseudo Random Numbers from /dev/urandom
###### step 1 
```sh 
$ watch -n .1 cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
$ cat /dev/urandom | hexdump
```
<img src="https://github.com/prashanthar2000/cryptography_lab/raw/master/1lab/urandom.png" width=1000 >


- Both /dev/random and /dev/urandom use the random data from the pool to generate pseudo random numbers.
- When the entropy is not sufficient, /dev/random will pause, while /dev/urandom will keep generating new numbers.
- as stated in the lab manual
- it genarates continuous stream of random numbers which intern changes the entropy

###### Step 2: Measure the quality of the random number using a tool called ent.
```sh 
$ head -c 1M /dev/urandom > output.bin
$ ent output.bin
Entropy = 7.999815 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1048576 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1048576 samples is 268.82, and randomly
would exceed this value 26.42 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5868 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.140957416 (error 0.02 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000720 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).

```

- entropy = 7.999.... bits per bytes indicate that the file is extremely dense in informationâ€”essentially random. Hence, compression of the file is unlikely to reduce its size.
- as it is random compression is not possible ie 0% compression on the file 
- The chi-square test is the most commonly used test for the randomness of data
- 26.42% indicates how frequently a truly random sequence would exceed the value calculated
- Its a simple arithmetic mean of all bytes . Value above 127.5 indicates its random
- Monte Carlo value for Pi will be close to Pi value if it is random .
- In our case its just 0.02% therefore we can consider it as random
- Serial correlation coefficient -- This quantity measures the extent to which each byte in the file depends upon the previous byte
- for a random number this value will be close to 0 

###### Step 3: The program from Task 1 can be modified to write a new 128 bit key using /dev/urandom
```sh 
$ gcc task5.c -o task5
$ ./task5
$ ./task5
```
<img src="https://github.com/prashanthar2000/cryptography_lab/raw/master/1lab/trulyrandom.png" width=1000 >

- the values are truly random numbers 
- values are read from /dev/urandom therefore they are truly random numbers
