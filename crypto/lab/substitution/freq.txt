monoalphabetic cipher is a substitution cipher in which for a given key the cipher alphabet for each plain alphabet is fixed throughout the encryption process for example if a is encrypted as d for any number of occurrence in that plaintext a will always get encrypted d all of the substitution ciphers we have discussed earlier in the chapter are monoalphabetic these ciphers are highly susceptible to cryptanalysis polyalphabetic cipher is a substitution cipher in which the cipher alphabet for the plaintext
