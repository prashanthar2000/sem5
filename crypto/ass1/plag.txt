Further a new protocol WPA2 was proposed by the Wi-Fi alliance which uses AES block cipher as an encryption algorithm instead of RC4. 
Though WPA2 is a secure protocol, removing many weaknesses of WEP and WPA but its hardware based applications are not cost effective as compare to WEP and WPA where RC4 was used as a basic module

insecure . . Further
inspite of all the developments reported in the literature, there
are still many open research challenges and issues related
to searches of more biases, key collisions in keystream, and
key recovery attack on WPA .The conclusion is there is still
research going on , on RC4 to make it more efficient and
effective encryption algorithm


CONCLUSION
In this paper i have presented a brief study of RC4
,about is robust feature and its weaknesses . How easy
it is to implement on hardware and software .We have
presented a broad varieties of RC4 algorithms improving the
security aspects of RC4 . It was widely used in wireless
communication( like WEP and WPA) and web security like
TLS/SSL until it was declared to be insecure . . Further
inspite of all the developments reported in the literature, there
are still many open research challenges and issues related
to searches of more biases, key collisions in keystream, and
key recovery attack on WPA .The conclusion is there is still
research going on , on RC4 to make it more efficient and
effective encryption algorithm.
