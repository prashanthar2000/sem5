data structure used is a binary tree 
Implementaion of general purpose tree using binary tree .
struct node
{
    char *key;
    struct node *left;
    struct node *right;
}
create_node creates a node_t and returns its pointer 
add_node adds a node give the parent 
    it searchs for left node if its null then no child is present so create node 
    if left is present traverse to right till u hit NULL create node there
memo keep track of parent nodes 
main_gen takes tree as parameter and generates the code for it
gen_while,gen_case,prolong,gen_header,close while, close case are sir code with minor changes
gen_tree is a wrapper function for gen_tree_r
its  a recursive code (kind of inorder traversal) keeping track of case count and which level it is currently in

takeaway from the assignment 
we learnt about GPT using binary tree 
how to generate code . 

could have been more challenging hope will get more challenging assignment from now on
